Welcome to my blog, *Almost Surely* <br />
Admittedly, I am a complete noob when it comes to web devlopment and I will probably never excel in this domain. However, thanks to <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/#css">this</a> excellent post by Hank Quinlan, I was able to set up this website. Thanks Hank!

The name of the blog calls for some explanation. The term *Almost Surely* stems from probability theory where one says an event[^1]<sup>1</sup> happens almost surely if the event happens with probability 1. Why use the term *almost* surely for an event that is guranteed to happen (i.e has a probability of 1)? why not just say the event *surely* happens? The reason is that sometimes we would like to allow an event to happen with probability 1 even if there are possible excepetions for the event. The possible excepections are actually impossible as their total probability is zero. As an exmaple consider a disk shaped dart board and assume I throw a dart at the board. The probability that I will hit a certain region on the board is given by the ratio of the area of that region to the total area of the board. If I'm not to terrible of a sh So the probability that I will **not** hit the center point of the board is zero. 


Explain the origin of the name of the blog
The posts in this blog will either adress only one subject or will combine several subjects
Some posts will more theoretical and some will be on the applied side.

[^1]: <sup>1</sup> In probability theory, the term *event* has a slightly technical definition. For this purpose just think of an event as the <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/event"> dictionary definition</a> - *a thing that happens*.
